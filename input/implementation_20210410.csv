These pathogens can cause plethora of infections such as respiratory infection, bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection, meningitis and intra-abdominal infection.  Carbapenem is an important antibiotic of last resort to treat Gram-negative clinical infections. Unfortunately, carbapenem-resistant emerges due to the overuse and misuse of carbapenem antibiotics. Aggravating this problem further, is the carbapenemase gene acquired by these pathogens which are carried on plasmids. It is evident that these plasmid-borne carbapenemases (IMP-like, VIM-like, NDM-like and KPC-like) have disseminated globally, causing a public health threat and further limiting therapeutic options. Therefore, old drugs such as colistin had to be repurposed alongside unorthodox combination therapy.  It is therefore of paramount importance to ensure that AMR in Brunei Darussalam in the human sector is controlled in order to prevent the ?antibiotic apocalypse? where no more antibiotic can be used to stop infections. Implementing surveillance through the use of important diagnostic tools (phenotypic, rapid testing or genotypic) are key to prevent AMR.  In the context of our diagnostic routine National Clinical Microbiology Reference Laboratory, the AMR activities includes bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing and identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) using rapid lateral flow assay tests. National Clinical Microbiology Reference Laboratory also participates in External Quality Assurance program from the RCPAQAP (Royal College of Pathologists Australasia Quality Assurance Programs) and WHO GASP (Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme).  In addition, the term of reference for the National Surveillance Centre (National Coordinating Centre) includes:  1.	To coordinate the AMR surveillance system. This includes the collation and aggregation of data from data reporting sites (human health). While the initial emphasis is on human clinical pathogens, in line with WHO, the expectation is that AMR surveillance, in the long term, be embedded in a One Health approach. In this context, it is expected that AMR surveillance systems will develop progressively to include agriculture (including animal health) and the environment.  2.	The agreed data reporting sites are as follows:  ?	Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Services, Ministry of Health: -	AMR data according to WHO GLASS priority pathogens (selected) and antimicrobials -	To also include data from private laboratories  ?	Department of Pharmacy Services, Ministry of Health -	Antimicrobial consumption data in defined daily dose from public and private sectors for all antimicrobials  ?	Department of Agriculture & Agrifoods, Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism -	Data on priority pathogens: E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter and S. aureus from food producing animals. -	Antimicrobial consumption data in animal population  3.	To conduct surveillance data analysis, either descriptive or analytical epidemiology, at national and/or sub-national level to inform any necessary interventions.  4.	Dissemination of data to Technical Working Group (TWG)-2 (surveillance and research) and other relevant stakeholders that can support and inform recommendations of Brunei Darussalam AMR Committee (BDAMRC) including a local antimicrobial prescribing guidelines and infection control policies.  5.	Collaborate with relevant stakeholders and international partners, including WHO, to ensure appropriate analysis of national and regional initiatives. This may include identification of capacity building activities, at national and international level, for data providers, analysts, and users.  6.	To assist TWG2 in providing an annual report of surveillance activities and key findings to BDAMRC.  "

NESID AMR surveillance consists of pathogen reporting (laboratory-based surveillance) and patient reporting. The information is based on reporting from physicians. The system is pursuant to Articles 12 through 16 of the Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases, and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases in effect since April 1, 1999. Notifiable infectious diseases in NESID AMR surveillance are carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteraceae infection, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infection, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infection all of which belong to category V infectious diseases and diseases to be reported by designated sentinel sites are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. JANIS collects comprehensive specimen-based data (i.e., both culture-positive and -negative data of all sample types) from diagnostic microbiology laboratories of participating hospitals to monitor the isolation rate of 11 major bacteria and specific AMR bacteria and creating antibiograms of approximately 20 bacterial species.  The comprehensive data collection scheme enabled JANIS to determine the total number of patients from whom the specimens were collected.  The data are regularly uploaded from hospitals through a web interface to a secure cloud system, according to a specific data format for each sample. Automatic data preparation functions have been developed and installed in automated microbiology systems such as MicroScan or Vitek or within the laboratory information systems used in the participating hospitals and commercial clinical laboratories. The uploaded data were stored in a database and processed in the JANIS server-side tabulation program. After automatic data check and de-duplication, Resistant-Intermediate-Susceptible (R-I-S) interpretation of the quantitative susceptibility test data was conducted using the 2012 version of CLSI breakpoints, enabling direct comparison of resistance rates among participating hospitals and monitoring the longitudinal trend of AMR. The JANIS server-side program then creates annual national reports. In addition, the JANIS server-side program also creates individual facility feedback reports, which are returned to each participating hospital and readily highlight the facility-specific isolation and resistance rates of specific AMR bacteria for each hospital compared to the national distribution of the previous year.

The remaining 3 sites complete an excel database, which is then sent the national AMR surveillance secretariat to be uploaded to AMR web-based reporting.  5 sentinel sites sent isolates to NRL for confirmatory testing including for identification and AST. NRL provides feedback on the discrepancy results to the AMR sentinel sites.  There is a monthly meeting for the AMR Technical Working Group to discuss progress and challenges with partners, the animal health sector, and environment colleagues. The national AMR surveillance team conducts quarterly supervision to each site using a standard checklist to strengthen microbiology, AMR reporting, infection prevention and control, and rational use of antibiotics.  The annual AMR surveillance review workshops were conducted to review the progress and challenges of implementing surveillance and the development of local action plans to strengthen surveillance.  One of the priorities for 2021 is to regularly analyze the surveillance data and produce a quarterly AMR surveillance bulletin and to enhance the use AMR data for improving infection control and rational use of antibiotics in the hospitals."

It has 24 sentinel sites and 2 gonorrhea surveillance sites.  The sentinel sites participate in an external quality assessment scheme (EQAS) to ensure quality of laboratory results. Periodic monitoring visits to sentinel sites are likewise done. All sentinel sites implement standard methods for culture and susceptibility testing based on the WHO Manual for the Laboratory Identification and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Pathogens of Public Health Importance in the Developing World and updated Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing and quality control.   Using a standard format, routine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are sent by the sentinel sites to the coordinating laboratory of the program? the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reference Laboratory (ARSRL) at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. Sentinel sites likewise send isolates with unusual antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ARSRL for confirmatory testing.  The culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test results are encoded using WHONET. The ARSRL?s Data Management Unit manages the cleaning, analysis, storage and security of the program?s surveillance data.  TESTING METHODS. At the reference laboratory, all referred isolates with unusual susceptibility patterns are re-identified using both automated (Vitek) and convention methods.  Both minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) via automated method (Vitek) and disk diffusion are employed in antimicrobial susceptibility testing.   Further confirmatory tests are done such as: serotyping for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Salmonellae, and Vibrio cholerae; and identification of genes conferring antimicrobial resistance by multiplex PCR.   In the analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, an isolate is considered resistant to an antimicrobial agent when tested and interpreted as resistant (R) in accordance with the clinical breakpoint criteria based on the most recent Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) references for antibiotic susceptibility testing. DATA ANALYSIS. Analysis is restricted to the first isolate received (per genus under surveillance) per patient in the calendar year. Data are expressed as a cumulative resistance percentage, i.e. the percentage of resistant isolates out of all isolates with antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) information on that specific organism?antimicrobial agent combination. Only species with testing data for 30 or more isolates are included in the analysis. An annual report with a summary of the surveillance data focusing on aerobic bacterial pathogens of public health importance causing common infectious diseases with significant morbidity and mortality locally are disseminated to the program?s stakeholders.

The NCC will identify priority pathogens, sample sites and pathogen-antimicrobials combinations in humans and animals, based on the country?s AMR situation. NCC will develop a One Health AMR surveillance plan in humans, animal and food (sample selection, number of samples, sample processing, logistics). NCC will assess and inventory resources for monitoring, surveillance and testing sentinel environmental sites for antimicrobial resistant organisms and antimicrobial agents. NCC will train surveillance staff and clinical staff in AMR surveillance and lab techniques according to GLASS standards. NCC will develop an integrated human and animal IT platform for AMR surveillance reporting. WHONET platform will be implemented for AMR surveillance data entry, storage and transmission. NCC will implement a national AMR surveillance program that is representative of the country situation but with limited number of operational sites. Maliana and Baucau Municipality will be targeted in the pilot phase. Regular data of AMR along with resistance profiles of priority pathogens for human, animal and food will be made available to NCC from limited number of sites in the two target municipalities. The NCC will establish formal linkages between national AMR surveillance programme and WHO GLASS. Reporting to GLASS will commence after formal assessment of national AMR surveillance program pilots. TWG (Surveillance) will conduct a formal assessment of National AMR surveillance followed by recommendations of nationwide scale up."
